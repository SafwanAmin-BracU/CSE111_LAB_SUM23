    "### Movie Theater Management System\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a growing excitement in movie theaters these days, with many people flocking to watch a variety of movies, including titles like \"Barbie,\" \"Oppenheimer,\" and various Bengali films. To cater to this demand, Star Cinema, a popular movie theater, is expanding its reach by opening new branches. Each branch will showcase a collection of movies to entertain the audience. To implement this, we'll design two classes: `StarCinema` and `Movie`, utilizing a HAS-A relationship through the concept of class/static variables and class methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Movie Class\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: string - Name of the movie.\n",
    "- `genre`: string - Genre of the movie.\n",
    "- `duration`: int - Duration of the movie in minutes.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `movieInfo()`: Returns a formatted string containing the name, genre, and duration of the movie.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `createMovie_fromString(string)`: Creates a new `Movie` object using a string containing name, genre, and duration separated by hyphens ('-').\n",
    "\n",
    "#### StarCinema Class\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `branch_name`: string - Name of the StarCinema branch.\n",
    "- `movie_list`: list - List of `Movie` objects added to the branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- `all_branch_info`: dictionary - Stores branch names of Star Cinema branches as keys and lists of `Movie` objects for each branch as values.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Instance Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `addMovies(*movie_objects)`: Adds multiple `Movie` objects to the `movie_list` and updates the `all_branch_info` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `removeMovie(Movie_Object)`: Removes a specified `Movie` object from the `movie_list` and updates the `all_branch_info` accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Class Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "- `check(string)`: Displays information about a movie, including the branches where it is streaming, its duration, and genre. If the movie is not streaming in any branch, it shows a message stating that the movie is not being streamed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `showAllBranchInfo()`: Prints information about all branches and their respective movies using the data from the `all_branch_info` variable. The output includes branch names, movie numbers, names, genres, and durations. The `movieInfo()` method from the `Movie` class is used to display movie details.\n"
